# Machine-Learning-Approaches-to-Breast-Cancer
This project explores machine-learning approaches for early breast-cancer detection using a small clinical dataset of 116 women (64 cases, 52 controls) collected at the University Hospital Centre of Coimbra. Nine blood-based biomarkers (e.g., glucose, insulin, HOMA, adiponectin, resistin) and anthropometric variables (age, BMI) serve as predictors. The workflow includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development with LASSO-regularised logistic regression, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines. Cross-validation identified the Random Forest as the most stable performer (AUC â‰ˆ 0.86), while a spline-enhanced logistic model achieved an AUC of 0.90, demonstrating the potential of nonlinear terms for improved accuracy.
